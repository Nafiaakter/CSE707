Title: Exploratory Study of TF-IDF Text Feature Extraction in Apache Spark for Big Data Text Mining
Task Type: Literature Review with Code Analysis and EDA 
Overview: As my task is targeted on reviewing huge-scale textual content mining in disbursed environments, I explored a realistic evidence-of-concept the use of Apache Spark’s MLlib library to process and extract functions from textual content records the use of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm.
This was done the usage of pattern Spark code (linked underneath), wherein a listing of documents turned into converted into time period vectors and TF-IDF scores using distributed processing.
Steps Taken:
* Installed Apache Spark and PySpark
* Used a small dummy dataset simulating a large corpus (3–5 documents)
* Applied Tokenizer, HashingTF, and IDF from pyspark.Ml.Function
* Extracted top TF-IDF rankings according to report

The usage of Spark ML Pipeline:
* Tokenization of words
* Stopwords removed
* Bigrams generated (2-word terms)
* TF-IDF capabilities computed

Conclusion: This test demonstrates how distributed textual content mining pipelines can be applied and analyzed the use of Apache Spark. Even with a small dataset, I become capable of simulate actual-world preprocessing and advantage insights the usage of EDA. This supports my scientific literature assessment.
